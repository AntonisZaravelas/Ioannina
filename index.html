            <h2>What's this city?</h2>
            <p>
                Ioannina (Greek: Ιωάννινα Ioánnina [i.oˈa.ni.na]), often called Yannena (Γιάννενα
                Yánnena [ˈʝa.ne.na]) within Greece, is the capital and largest city of the Ioannina regional unit and of
                Epirus,
                an administrative region in north-western Greece. According to the 2011 census, the city population was
                65,574,
                while the municipality had 112,486 inhabitants.[2] It lies at an elevation of approximately 500 metres
                (1,640
                feet) above sea level, on the western shore of lake Pamvotis (Παμβώτις). Ioannina is located 410 km (255
                mi)
                northwest of Athens, 260 kilometres (162 miles) southwest of Thessaloniki and 80 km (50 miles) east of
                the
                port
                of Igoumenitsa in the Ionian Sea.

            <p>The city's foundation has traditionally been ascribed to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in the 6th
                century
                AD, but modern archaeological research has uncovered evidence of Hellenistic settlements. Ioannina
                flourished in the late Byzantine period (13th–15th centuries). It became part of the Despotate of Epirus
                following the Fourth Crusade and many wealthy Byzantine families fled there following the sack of
                Constantinople, with the city experiencing great prosperity and considerable autonomy, despite the
                political
                turmoils. Ioannina surrendered to the Ottomans in 1430 and until 1868 it was the administrative center
                of
                the Pashalik of Yanina. In the period between the 18th and 19th centuries, the city was a major center
                of
                the modern Greek Enlightenment.[3][4][5][6] Ioannina was ceded to Greece in 1913 following the Balkan
                Wars.
                The city has two hospitals, the General Hospital of Ioannina "G. Hatzikosta", and the University
                Hospital of
                Ioannina. It is also the seat of the University of Ioannina. The city's emblem consists of the portrait
                of
                the Byzantine Emperor Justinian crowned by a stylized depiction of the nearby ancient theater of Dodona.

            <p>The routes around the lake offer exquisite scenery and plenty to explore. A tour by car is an experience
                to suit all kinds of traveller - there is much to see, much to learn about, and there is the serene
                calming effect of the lake.
                Towards the north exit from Ioannina, on the Metsovo arterial road, is the church of Agios Nikolaos ton
                Kopanon (‘St Nicholas of the Beaters’), named for the women who beat the clothes as they did their
                washing in the nearby traditional stone watermills by the lake. Tradition has it that Kyra-Frosini, the
                notorious mistress of Ali Pasha, was imprisoned here.

                As the road continues on, it leads to one of the most beautiful caves in Europe, Perama. The cave, a
                product of karst formation, dates back about one and a half million years. The beauty of the chambers
                defies description. It seems impossible that the hall of the Cross, with its limestone worshippers, was
                formed without human intervention, and yet, it is a natural sculpture of truly stunning proportions. The
                Hall of Legendary Palaces looks like a fairy house.The stalactites projecting from the ceiling look like
                surprisingly complex yet harmoniously constructed chandeliers. The area around the cave is an ideal spot
                from which to look out over the lake and feel the magic of nature. The small train that runs from
                Ioannina to the picturesque village of Perama is a nostalgic choice of transport.</p>

            <p>The silversmith’s art is one of the most important aspects of local culture in Ioannina. The wirework or
                cast jewellery of Epirus, the exquisite "tzovairia" were famous beyond the Greek territories. The
                expression "Arta and Ioannina" meant - and is still used to mean - "all the wealth of the earth".

                The beautiful jewellery of Ioannina, of traditional or original modern designs is still synonymous with
                understated elegance. Delicate earrings, intricate chains, ornate buckles, and silver ornaments are only
                fragments of the variety of craftwork that visitors can admire in the town’s jewellers’ shops.</p>

            <p>To be honest, the weather in Ioannina is most of the time foggy in the winter and autumn, but in the
                summer it's really hot and sizzling. People here tend to be friendly
                and love offering φιλοξενία ( is the relationship between a guest and a host, where in the host receives
                the guest with goodwill, including the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors, or strangers.)
                Φιλοξενία is a greek word which comes from φίλος+ξένος (to be the friend of a stranger).
            </p>
            <p>
                Some thing about the biology of the lake: Urbanisation and pollution are threatening the lake ecosystem,
                home to small mammals, waterbirds and a rich fish and crustacean fauna. Eutrophication results in algal
                blooms in summer. Lake Pamvotida is home to Tsima (Τσίμα), a species of fish endemic to the lake. Two
                bryozoan species have recently been reported from the lake.
